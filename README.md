# Project OrangeJuice

Project Orange Juice is a 2D game on the Unity engine with pixel art graphics. 
The game is supposed to be similar to the Stardew-Valley game where you grow plants, breed animals, hunt animals, collect materials in mines and forests, and solve tasks assigned by NPCs in the city. The combat system is similar to the typical Rouge like with a dash and a series of 3 attacks. I also plan to add fishing and diving mechanics. 

I am currently at the stage of creating animation textures for the character who will be presented as a sprite with textures applied that match the animations.
